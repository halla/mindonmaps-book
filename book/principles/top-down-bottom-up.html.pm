Sometimes you start with generating a lot of ideas and only later organize them to categories, when you start noticing patterns. On the other hand, sometimes you already have the categories, a clearly defined set of questions to answer or boxes to be fill. 

To keep an open mind, let the content drive the structure. First create a collection of ideas, then organize it. If you want to do any out-of-the-box thinking the easiest way to do it is to not put yourself in a box in the first place. By creating a table of contents, an outline or a categorization, you are in effect defining the box. Predefining the structure will get in your way by directing and limiting your thinking.

Directing and limiting can also be a good thing, especially when you are repeating something. You don't need creativity to do routine tasks. The more you repeat something, the less you'll probably want to think about it! Nevertheless, you'll want to make sure that every aspect gets covered. Checklists and standard forms are useful for that.
