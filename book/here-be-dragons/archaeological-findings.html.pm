◊leading-words{Sometimes} you might want to leave your daily mind maps behind and set out for an exploration in the jungles of your past maps. That often ends up as a struggle through meaningless weeds as you'll find many notes that don't mean anything to you anymore. You have to cross a river but you find that the bridge has collapsed as you try find your way to the related maps when the links are broken. You get lost, find yourself walking in circles. Sometimes two places look identical and you cannot make sense which one is which since you made a copy of the map at some point in the past.

Going through your old mind maps can be a sort of an adventure itself. Even though it can sometimes be hard to navigate and decipher your old maps, you can learn a lot by doing that every once in a while. You'll learn about yourself and how your way of thinking has changed during the time. The maps will become an endless source for good memories as well as new ideas. Many times, especially when our life situation or environment changes, our thoughts will change too. Old mind maps can show you what was important to you in the past and how your priorities in life have changed along the way.
