◊h1{Moving between maps}

◊leading-words{As the number} of your mind maps grow, you'll find that the need to move and switch between different maps grows as well. There are several ways to move between the maps, and this is also more or less specific to the application you use. 

You can typically open a mind map file directly by browsing the file system, but it's not always the easiest way. If you are in the middle of a thought, a way to move between maps without breaking your flow is through associative links you have put in place. These are links inside a map pointing to another map. Your map called Europe can contain links to maps about specific countries and the other way around. You can then follow these links to move between these maps. You can also create specific index maps to quickly navigate between a large number of maps.

It's a good idea to develop yourself a quick and smooth way to navigate your maps. Too big indexes or having to browse through too many files floods your working memory with irrelevant ideas and you'll get easily distracted. The next thing you notice you are in YouTube watching cat videos, wondering what you were doing before ending up there. So, make it easy for yourself.
