◊h1{Review and reflect}

◊leading-words{Sometimes} you just want to browse through your old maps and review them. You can do systematic reviews of your notes, or you can browse through them at random every now and then. A review can significantly increase your retention rate of new things. You can browse around your maps and notice how the way of your thinking and using mind maps has changed over time. Your thinking style probably differs between different subjects too. You might have a certain approach to your personal life and another to your work life. Noticing these changes and differences can teach you a lot about yourself. 

The more maps you have on different subjects, the richer source of new ideas you are going to have. That's because one way to come up with new ideas is to combine two old ideas together. By wandering around your maps aimlessly, randomly, you can make new and unexpected associations and connections between ideas. Lots of “Aha!” moments waiting for you here.
