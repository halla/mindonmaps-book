◊h1{Maintenance}

◊leading-words{Take regularly} some time off from your thinking and learning and spend some time on gardening, weeding, cleaning, taking the garbage out and sharpening the saw. Your maps are going to collect all kinds of clutter, that makes using them harder and distract you from the main purpose, or restrict generation of new ideas. 

Maintenance is also the time you'll clean up all the temporary storages you've been accumulating since the last cleaning day. Move the items to their right places, or move them to the recycling bin. Or just delete them. Remaining undecided about them leaves you with unfinished business that's going to haunt you forever. Or until you clean them up. So clean them up.
