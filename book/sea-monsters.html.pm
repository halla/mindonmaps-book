◊h1{Sea monsters and archeology}

Like the ancient map makers already knew, at the edge of the world lies the realm of monsters. The same goes for mind maps. When you do a lot of mind mapping and exploring your thoughts, you'll eventually come to the edge of your inner world. You'll encounter new thoughts and thought patterns. Some of them useful, some of them not, some just very confusing. You'll encounter old thoughts that you've tried to forget. This can be intimidating, even plain scary. The following are of some of the things that you'll meet along the way.

◊h2{Great Whales}

Just because it is possible to have a million items in a single map, and even have it organized, doesn't mean you should do that. It can be tempting to do so, because it might make you feel good to see how many things you have in your mind. You can also create some visually attractive images of them and impress your friends. The problem is that the larger the map gets, the slower it becomes to work with it. Looking up things and adding new ones to a huge map can become so difficult that you simply don't want to do it anymore. Making changes to the structure gets harder, too, because your map has become, well, a whale. 

Let's do the math again. You have five levels of items, five items on each level. It kind of sounds reasonable, don't you think? How many items you have in total? 3125. I'm not sure one needs to be aware of that many things at any one time. Someday you'll start cleaning up the map and you'll find living people inside the stomach of your whale. You'll find notes and ideas that have been buried there for years without anyone remembering. The concept of refactoring comes to mind. Split the map into smaller ones, and link them together if needed.

◊h2{All-eaters}

This is typically a result of sloppy concepts and perfectionism. They are mostly harmless, but can be quite confusing. You try to figure out a perfect categorization for the whole universe and get seduced by some brilliant idea. Soon you find out that if you look close enough, you can put all the things in the world to this box. Strangely enough, you can often find an opposing idea and fit everything to that box too. You can learn to live with all-eaters and they can be very useful too. In fact, some all-eaters appear in this book too, such as the “content” category. The way to understand these is to realize that the problem is, again, in box-thinking. The world doesn't come in neatly defined boxes, it's us who put it there. We try to put shades of grey into boxes called 'black' and 'white'. 

◊h2{Time: Past-Future}

As an example of an all-eater, consider the concept of time. Organizing things on a timeline is something most of us do all the time. You might be tempted to organize everything by time in your mind maps too, but that's likely to lead you to a few dead-ends. 

Everything that you know has happened in the past. Even the thoughts you are aware of right now already happened. In this sense, there is no such thing as the future. The things that you associate with future are just past memories, too. If you think this way, you end up with one single map called Past that ends up eating everything.

The same thing happens if you consider the reasons for particular things in your maps. You can put them again all in to past (“I did this, because some event in the past”), but you can just as well find a reason from the future (“I did this because where I want to be tomorrow”). This way the future can become a similar black hole as well. There is really no way to separate those two kinds of reasoning, the past-looking deterministic and the future-oriented teleological one. Neither is the right one. Either one can be useful, depending on the context. 

◊h2{Sphinx of philosophy}

If you spend a lot of time thinking with your mind maps you are going to run into questions that have no good answers. As you know or don't know, the sphinx, besides a big old statue with a broken nose, is a mythological figure who asked riddles. If you couldn't answer his question... Well, you really wanted to be able to answer his question. The sphinx of philosophy is similar, only that there are no right answers. You fail if you don't really believe your answer yourself. You pass if you do have a good answer that you are comfortable with.

Many people consider subjects like philosophy as something utterly impractical. To me it's just the opposite. It's true that it's hard to feed a family just by contemplating the nature of bread, but that's exactly what you might find yourself doing if you create a mind map called 'bread'. When you want to organize and categorize the content in your mind maps ever better, you need to be able to make finer distinctions between your thoughts and the reality.

I don't know if you ever took an introductory course in philosophy or stopped to look and marvel at your hand for a very long time for some other reason. Or maybe you already started to wonder whether such a figure as the sphinx even existed, I mean where's the proof? At that point it might help to google about ontology and epistemology. You might not find the answers for the sphinx right away, but at least you'll find out that you are not alone with them.

You have to find your own strategy to deal with the sphinx. If you cannot come up with good answers straight away, maybe you can just slip past by shutting your ears, not listening to him. Maybe you can reply with another question? Buy yourself some more time to find your solution.

◊h2{Windmills of word definitions}

Sometimes you come up with words you don't quite understand. Even though you'll meet some people who claim to have higher knowledge about the exact meaning of words, words have a different meaning to everybody, no matter what some websford dictionary definition says what it should be. 

What is the meaning of life? Oh no, I don't know the answer, am I doomed? In those cases it is time to stop and think how well do you understand the question in the first place. Life? You mean my life or life on this planet? Last time you asked me about the purpose of life, now you talk about the meaning. Isn't that a different thing? And why are you suggesting there is only one meaning to life? You'll find that you can often solve problems just by defining the questions carefully, and being more specific about the meaning of the words. When it comes to word definitions in your personal thinking, you don't actually have to care at all about official meanings of words. It is enough that you agree with yourself what you mean by a given word. 

◊h2{Personal demons}

Think about something uncomfortable. Oh, you don't want to? That's the whole point. When you start digging into your thoughts you are bound to find stuff that you have intentionally wanted to forget. You might want to sharpen your emotional skills to be able to deal with these better. If you meet some serious dragons, we are starting to talk about therapy here. I don't want to claim that you should try to fix yourself. Better do that with a help of a professional. 

All the demons, big or small, are blocking your thoughts. They can be easy ones, like some bad memory from your childhood where some helpful adult told you how bad you are at something like math, drawing, athletics or whatever. You have associated so much bad feelings to the subject that you have stopped progressing in it. How could you get better at math if you start feeling bad from just the thought of doing it?

Mind mapping can help you sort out your thoughts and feelings in a couple of different ways. First, you can map out where the problems are, and avoid them or learn to better live with them. Denying the issues and wiping them under the carpet rarely is a very durable solution. Secondly, writing things down can help you distance yourself from those memories, to get a more objective view by looking at them from the outside. Finally, you can more easily discover repeating thought patterns, circular logic, and gaps and omissions in your internal arguments.

◊h2{Archaeological findings}

Sometimes you might want to leave your daily mind maps behind and set out for an exploration in the jungles of your past maps. That often ends up as a struggle through meaningless weeds as you'll find many notes that don't mean anything to you anymore. You have to cross a river but you find that the bridge has collapsed as you try find your way to the related maps when the links are broken. You get lost, find yourself walking in circles. Sometimes two places look identical and you cannot make sense which one is which since you made a copy of the map at some point in the past.

Going through your old mind maps can be a sort of an adventure itself. Even though it can sometimes be hard to navigate and decipher your old maps, you can learn a lot by doing that every once in a while. You'll learn about yourself and how your way of thinking has changed during the time. The maps will become an endless source for good memories as well as new ideas. Many times, especially when our life situation or environment changes, our thoughts will change too. Old mind maps can show you what was important to you in the past and how your priorities in life have changed along the way.

◊h2{Dinosaurs}

Dinosaurs are essentially whales that you forgot about. You go through your old maps and come across a massive one that you didn't even remember existed. First you might be marveling that such a great creature existed. Then you start to ponder the reason behind the disappearance. Was there a catastrophe? If there was, could it happen again? It might be that a giant meteorite destroyed your hard drive 60 million seconds ago and you found the incomplete remnants of your ancient mind maps on a backup-disk. Another explanation is that they couldn't adapt to the changing environment and were gradually replaced by more viable species of maps. You wisely consider both alternatives and make sure your maps are regularly backed up in the future. You also analyze the maps for clues about what exactly was it about the maps or the environment that lead to the extinction.

Based on the evidence I've found by looking at my historical maps, dinosaurs were quite prevalent and ruled my mind maps for many years in the early days. At some point they appear to have all disappeared in a quite a short time. They were replaced by smaller, more flexible and adaptive maps that started to follow the principle of information hiding. 

The biggest dinosaur that I've found is a map called “The center”. I found it when writing this book and I dated it back to somewhere around 2004. It contained over 30 000 items, probably being an attempt to “figure it all out”. Or maybe it was just an experiment to see how well it works if I bring all my maps together to one massive index. Well, it wasn't very useful, but it made for a pretty picture. You can see a visualization of the map in the cover of this book.
