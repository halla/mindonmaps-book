◊h1{Exploring your maps}

After some time you'll find that you've created yourself lots of different mind maps on many different subjects. You'll find recurring structures in your maps but also many differences between them. 

◊h2{Structure of the maps}

Mind maps look tree-like with branches growing out of the center of the map. A map typically starts as a list: you just write one idea after another without any structure. As you combine that list under a common topic it becomes a tree. If you create links between separate branches of the tree the map becomes a network.

◊h3{Trees and networks}

Is the map a tree or a network? Strictly speaking it is a tree only when there is only one path from any one item, or node, to another. If you connect two nodes in different branches you have changed it to a network, or a graph as it's sometimes called. 

Which one is better? You might be tempted to draw connections everywhere. After all, you can find some sort of a relationship between any two things in the universe if you just think long enough. They might be useful sometimes, but for the most of the time you don't actually need them. 

Nowadays I very rarely use connections between branches inside a single map. What I do though, is linking maps to each other. 

◊h3{Maps of maps}

When you have more maps you probably start wanting to create links between them. As you do that, the collection of these maps itself forms similar structures as a single mind map. You can have a list of maps, each linking to next and previous one. Link the last map to the first, and you get a ring. Create an index map with links to many other maps and you have a tree.

I now have over 700 mind maps in my main map set. I only use a small subset of them actively, but if I need to I can reach any mind map from any other mind map by following the links I've created. Well, not always. Sometimes the links get broken over time, or I have a one-off map which I didn't remember to link anywhere. If there are no links pointing to a map, it makes finding them hard and they often get lost. 

By separating ideas in different maps connected by links you can manage even larger sets of ideas. You can still reach them all, while keeping the number of items considered at any one time low.

◊h3{Stacks}

A stack is just what it sounds like. You pile things on it. When you want to take things out, you start with the last one that you put in. You can use them to keep track of what you were doing, when you want to dig deeper into some issue or to take a side track. You can put the stuff that's on your mind to a stack when you switch a task. When you switch back, you can review what's on the stack and get back on track much quicker than just by trying to remember what you were doing. 

I find stacks especially useful in the morning when I start working. Opening a mind map application is the first thing I do after my computer boots up, and the first thing I do with the maps is to write down the things that are on my mind into a stack. It helps me clear my mind and also to put personal thoughts and problems aside when working. If I don't write them down those thoughts tend to pop up in my mind throughout the day and make it harder to concentrate on whatever I'm doing. I can do the same thing in the evening, too.

◊h3{Dynamic-Static: Is this map alive?}

I say that a map is alive when I do regularly changes in it, when it still evolves. Some maps are more dynamic, the evolve faster than others that remain more static. 

Which one is better? Consider a to-do list. If it's not changing then it's not working very well, is it? Then, take an index that you use to store links to the most important things you need all the time. If you need to make changes to it all the time, it isn't doing its job either. It's like the main menu in any computer application. You want it to be the familiar starting point. You don't want it to contain different items every time you access it.

Another way to look at this is through the distinctions of 'read' and 'write'. A good index is almost a read-only map. On the other hand, a temporary map you use as a scratchpad is often more write-only. You use it once to make notes or organize your thoughts, but then forget about it. Keep an eye on write-only elements in your dynamic maps. They might end up blocking your maps and therefore blocking your thoughts. 

◊h2{Functional Map Types}

Here is a brief overview of some of the different kinds of maps that you'll find yourself creating. Not all the maps can be categorized this clearly, but they often tend to fall into a few recurring categories. The main difference between the maps is their purpose, which leads to different kinds of map structures. They may not be apparent to you if you are just starting mind mapping but will become more so over time. You'll probably find your own map types that best serve your specific needs. The following are the types I find in my maps, presented roughly in the order that they emerged.

◊h3{Content}

Look around you and list everything you see. That's content. Make a to-do list of the places you want to see, and that's not so much content anymore. Write an article about a to-do list of the places you want to see, and it's content again. Everything is content, in a way. But some things are more than others. 

If it sounds a bit confusing don't worry, you're not alone. Content is the thing we are really interested about. In the first case, we are not interested about the to-do list itself, but about those things that are listed in it. In the article case, we are in fact interested about the to-do list because that is what we are writing about.

In fact, if you take a strict view of a mind map as a tool, there is no content in mind maps whatsoever. The content is what happens in the real world, as the result. In practice, however, it is useful to consider the edge of your mind maps as the content. This category makes probably more sense if you think it in relationship to the other types described below.

◊h3{Activity}

The focus of activity maps is on how to do things. In my case the activities might be such as writing, programming, data analysis, and photography. You might be interested in running, carpentry, or public speaking. The content of the maps might be such things as best practices, checklists, links to books and films about the subject and so on. 

In writing I want to separate the art and science of writing from the actual content I write. I don't learn about writing just because. I want to get better at it so I can create better writing. If you do handicrafts you might want to separate what you are actually doing, all the specific ideas and designs, from all the generic knowledge related to your art. When you work on your specific designs you can use the activity map as your guide book or reference manual. 

◊h3{Management}

Like in any organization doing any work, as the work gets more complicated, more layers of management gets added on top of the people who create the actual content. Management maps are specifically tuned to help you stay organized and to get things done. They might differ in scope, ranging from daily to-do lists to projects spanning several months or programs spanning several years. The main common thing is that these maps are future oriented. They describe a desired state of affairs in the future, a direction to go or specific action steps to be taken. A management map is a boss you meet regularly to discuss what to do the next week, the next month or the next year. 

◊h3{Index}

As the number of mind maps grows you might find yourself lost looking for specific maps. It's time to create an index map. There is typically little or no real content at all in these maps, just links to other maps. The whole point of an index map is to make moving from one map to another relatively easy even if there are many of them. It's like a corridor that connects many rooms together. 

To keep the index efficient you might want to limit the levels and the number of items on each level. You can create a good index using just 3 levels with 5 items on each one. If you think that is not enough, think again. 3 levels with 5 items each lets you reach 5x5x5=125 different maps, or 100 maps if you use only the leaf nodes for links. 4 levels, 10 items each would let you reach 10 000 maps (9000 leafs). A big index lets you reach everything, a lean index lets you reach the most important maps fast.
