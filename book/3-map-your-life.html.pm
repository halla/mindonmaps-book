◊h1{Map your life}

You can read all the theory and all the books you want, but it's practice that makes you great. In the following I'll discuss concepts and practices of mind mapping through four practical examples. These are ways I use mind maps all the time: reflecting on the past, planning for the future, learning something new and managing my projects and activities. If you follow through the steps in this chapter you'll be well on your way to exploring and managing your whole life in mind maps.

Self biography

Two acquaintances meet after years. The other one has just a vague idea of the last meeting while the other one a bit better: Oh yes, it was the Summer of 2005, we met in the Cafe X in London, on a Friday afternoon as I was returning home from work. Which one reminds you of yourself?

Completing this self biography exercise might not instantly give you a total recall of everything that's happened to you in your life. Still, you'll have taken a big step in that direction. You'll create a better index for your memories, which helps you create a better understanding of your life as a continuum from baby to the present day.

As you probably know, once you put something in your brain it can stay there forever. There are two main reasons for not remembering things. The first one is that those things were not stored well in the memory in the first place. That we can't do anything about afterwards. You may want to learn to memorize things better for the next time. The second reason for bad recall is that you're unable to find the memory in the midst of all the things that have been piling up in your mind during all the years. It's sometimes like trying to find the famous needle in the haystack when you don't even know where the haystack is.

The brain works through associations, but these don't always have to be that logical. In fact, any two things can get associated. Just as Pavlov's dogs started associating the bell to food, your memories are connected to each other in many different ways. You may not always remember things directly, but you can learn to search them through those associations. 

Age, year, life phases, locations, people

Write down numbers from 1 to whatever your age is. Under each number write one or two things you remember or know happening when you were that age. It probably helps to add the year next to the age, like 1979 - 1. You might think there is not much difference, but the brain has different associations stored for the age numbers and year numbers. If I think of age 18, one of the things that pop up is me getting my driving license. If, on the other hand I think of the year 1997 I think of high school exams. I probably filled a lot of papers, writing the year number in the exam papers. You might do a quick search for what happened during those years in the world. Reading old news brings back yet another set of different memories. If going through each and every year feels too much, think of major life phases instead, or just split the time in five or ten year slices instead.

One way that memories tend to be strongly associated is through location. Think about the places where you have lived, the specific buildings you've lived in or visited. Imagine being there again. What do you see? What are you doing physically? Are there other people? Listen. What do you hear? With a little practice, if you slow yourself down a bit and take your time, you can learn to move around in the places in your memories.

You might surprise yourself of how much you actually remember if you just stop and think about it. Typically “I don't remember” can be translated: I can't find the memory in five seconds. It's like googling the web and looking only at the first page of results to decide whether the answer can be found or not.

For now, just concentrate on listing as many different things as you can, without getting too much concerned with the details. After you've filled the mind map you'll have a nice overview of your whole life. Not to mention stories to share with your friends the next time you spend an evening together. 

Are the memories true

Well, no. Your memories are not always exactly true. Even if you are an autistic memory enigma, your memories won't be perfect images of the past. That's just not how the brain works, apparently. It's not a video camera, or a sound recorder. The memories are typically distorted in one way or another. 

A good example of distortion is the distinction between associated and dissociated memories. Sometimes when you think of yourself in the past, an image will come to mind where you see yourself doing something, like you were watching yourself from the outside. This sort of dissociated, objective memories are useful in many ways. They help to see the bigger picture and approach things analytically. They typically take much of the associated feelings away from the thoughts, too. There is just no way they can be exact memories of what you've seen or heard or done. We hardly ever actually see ourselves in reality. Well, unless we are looking at a mirror or seeing ourselves on a video. This is one more reason to do mind mapping, to write a personal journal, to take photos and to document things in other ways. You'll get access to at least some relatively undistorted information about your past. 

The Past

It's useful to be able to make a clear distinction between the past, the present and the future: your personal history, the current reality and your plans and predictions. By creating a separate map for your biography we have cleared the path for thinking about the future. You can come back to these maps anytime you feel like contemplating about your past. You can even make it a regular thing. Annual, monthly, weekly or even daily recaps are not really that hard to do. What if you would write down just one thing every single day? How many more good memories would you remember after a few weeks? How about after a month or a year? Too lazy to keep a diary? A few keywords a day will take you a long way.

Design your future

Admittedly, being a designer of your own life might sound a bit grandiose. Some people even take the view that you can't, or shouldn't, really plan anything but life just happens. It's true that you don't have to plan anything. Life will happen to you regardless. 

I didn't plan that much back when I was studying at the university. I ended up studying computer science even though that was not my first choice. Many others too were quite lost with their life plans, but some had put more thought to them than others. I started to get a bit annoyed by these people because they got so much more done than I did, and made it all seem so effortless. They got well paid jobs already in their freshmen year and still got their studies done faster while taking breaks traveling around the world or having a whole exchange year in some cool country abroad. One thing common to these people was that they knew exactly what they wanted to do, and they knew it a long time in advance. They planned ahead. 

Say, you would like to meet your friend on the weekend. Do you think you have better chances to meet someone if you start planning about it on Friday afternoon, or if you already started on Monday? You'd probably say Monday. What about if you want to become an astronaut, do you think it makes a difference whether you start planning and working towards it today or tomorrow? Well, not so much. But if you compare 10 and 20 years, you'll start to notice a difference. There's no way to guarantee that you'll find yourself in the outer space, but at least you are improving the probability if you start planning for it earlier.

Blank slate

When you start planning something new, a typical problem that arises is that all the old and existing comes into your way. You would do this and that, but you won't because something in your life, or in your mind, stops you. Starting with a blank slate is a useful technique to forget all that long enough to be able to find out what you really want. So put your past and your current situation aside for a moment. You probably had enough of those in the previous exercise anyway. 

What if there was an easy way to open your mind for new possibilities? What if you had a million dollars? What if you could do anything? What would you do if you were sure you would succeed? Asking what-if questions lets you first find what your ideal situation would look like. And yes, that is what is traditionally called dreaming. You can imagine your next weekend trip, a career change or whatever you think is important for you right now. 

Start a new map where you start answering those questions. Again, don't think too much, write out things from the top of your head to avoid getting stuck. Keep your thoughts flowing. If you start hearing yourself saying reasons and excuses to yourself for why something is not possible, write those in a separate list, but return your focus to the questions quickly again. Don't confuse what you want to what you think is possible. Also, if you find yourself coming up with concrete action steps write those into yet another list as well, but return to the original task. Thinking about the practical details is also getting ahead of yourself.

Brainstorm

When you have the big picture of what you want written down it's time to generate some ideas. Lots of ideas. First write down anything that comes to mind. Really. The quantity of ideas is more important than quality. If you feel stuck here, go through the section on thinking skills later in this book for ways of generating ideas. 

After you have a few dozen ideas written down you can pick up the best ones and refine those further. Bring those as close to concrete action steps as possible. Say you want to become an entrepreneur some day, you love flowers really much and your idea is to get a new job as soon as possible. Your concrete action could be to spend 15 minutes on the internet searching for how to do business with flowers online. If your action points are that clear, please put down this book and spend those fifteen minutes on your task. Your maps and I'll wait for you here until you get back.

The Future

Your plans are not the actual future. Even if the future in your mind has changed, the world outside doesn't change, until you act on your plans. They say that persistence is the key to achieving any goals in life, and it seems to me that our memory plays a big role in there. It's one thing to not give up in face of adversity, but there is something that comes even before that: you have to remember what you want. I've seen people give up their New Years resolutions, but I've also seen as many resolutions been forgotten about. Your mind maps can remind you about your plans and keep you on track.

We have now gone through one round of future planning. Quite simple, right? You'll probably want to come back to these ideas again and refine them further. Especially if you have recurring thoughts about making bigger changes in your life, write them down. Don't keep them in your head. That way you won't be thinking in circles anymore, but you can more easily get forward with your thoughts. Also, if you already have a clear one year plan, you might want to check back at your maps every once in a while. You can see whether your ideas about what you want have changed along the way, or if there is a need to change the direction again. 

Learn something new

Some people make the act of learning unnecessary complicated or associate it with unhappy school memories. The images that come to their mind are classrooms, bullies and grumpy teachers. They might make a New Year's resolution and pick a course starting in January. They go to the class and wait for the teacher to transfer their information to them. How boring is that? 

Don't wait. Start now. The internet is full of free resources you can get started with right away. Just go search for them. You can even enroll on free courses in the world best universities and be watching classes by superstar professors in just 10 minutes. The only thing you need is curiosity. 

Now, pick a subject. If you did the future design exercise, you probably have some ideas on what you want or need to learn next. If you don't have anything special in mind right now, take mind mapping and reading this book as your subject. Create a new map for it, before you move on.

Orientation

Show me what you already know. Start by listing out everything that comes to mind. If you picked something completely new to you, you might not come up with that many things at first. If you want to learn martial arts, you can start by listing all the kung-fu movies you've seen. Everything that comes to mind, including associations that might first look irrelevant or silly. This becomes the foundation on which you can start to build. Be clear with yourself what is your starting point: the strengths or handicaps you might have. If you want to learn algebra, hating math or being allergic to equations count as a handicap. 

What knowledge or skills are you after? What do you want or need to learn exactly? Write a list of those things. This is going to be the basis for your study plan. Don't even try to make it perfect at the first time. You can come back to revise it as you learn more about your subject. 

Why do you want to learn? Write a list of reasons you want to learn this subject for. Write a list of things you'll be able to do when you learn about it. When you are clear about why you want whatever you want, your motivation is going to be much stronger. 

Explore

Make a list of resources you can use for learning. Search the web, look for blogs, browse books on the subject, learn who is who in the field. You get a feel of what is available, and who are the other people learning about the same thing. Even if there is nobody who is even remotely interested in your subject where you live, there are probably hundreds or thousands on the internet. Go find them. It's much easier to learn anything if you have a community of like minded people around you. Maybe you'll find a good discussion forum on the subject, video lectures or complete online courses, free e-books, perhaps a book that is a must read. Many fields have specific respected authors or books or movies that people refer to. Those are good places to start. Maybe there are some events that you could attend, to learn about the subject and meet other learners. Exploration gives you an overview of the subject. You also make sure that you have the best possible learning resources at hand when you go further.

Study

Choose one of the learning resources on the list. Pick the one that suits you best and that you can access immediately. Start reading a book, join an online course, watch videos, listen to podcasts. Write down notes. Organize the notes. Read, listen, watch, apply in practice. Make notes along the way and come back to them to refresh your memory later on. 

How much notes should you make and what exactly to write down? You'll have to learn your own style for taking notes and organizing them, but no matter what your subject is, you are likely to be learning about concepts and their relationships. Beginners in anything often feel like they are learning a whole new language, because there are so many new words they have to pick up. 

Repeat

You don't become an expert in anything in one hour. It takes time, which means you'll need to continue this tomorrow, going through the three phases again. It's easy to get stuck in the details or lost exploring the internet forever. That's why, in the beginning, it's good to go through all the phases quickly but many times. 

On the first round you created yourself a framework and a study plan that makes it much easier to come back to the subject again another day. On the second round you'll be able to pick up where you left and to get deeper in each of three phases. Remember to clean up and reorganize your mind maps to make them better reflect your current understanding and study plans every time you do another round.

Review

Come back to your mind maps again after a day or two, a week, a month, a year, even if you are not actively studying the subject. If you do this, you can refresh what you've learned with a very light and fast review. If you just go through the material once and never come back to it, as so often happens in course-based learning, the material doesn't stick so well.

Let's get to work - start a project

So what is a project anyway? Sounds like work, huh? I call it a project when you want to get something done, something big enough that you need to do some planning and keep track of things. Or, in mind maps, it's big enough that you have at least one dedicated map for it, and probably it spans multiple maps. It's a way to get organized. The time scale can be a week or a year, whatever makes sense to your project. 

If you did the future design exercise, you should have something in your mind maps to start working on. Or maybe your life is perfect already, in which case you could start a book or a movie project to let others know how you made it happen.

The structure I find myself using is loosely based on systems methodology. A technical description would be that a project is a future-oriented system that produces an output, or a change in the environment. It is a way to organize yourself, your actions, and your resources to reach a specific goal. 

Management

It's useful to separate the management of the project from the actual content. When in management mode, you put on the boss hat and think about the project as a whole. What are the things needed to be done and when, who are the people related to this project and what are the goals. You can create a management branch in your project map, or a separate management map, depending on the size of the project. 

Content

If you run your own one man project you need to put your hands in the dirt as well. In the case of a book writing project the main content is the content of the book. The actual text is probably edited somewhere else, but part of the process can be done in mind maps, such as all the ideas and notes about how to improve the text, as well as the outline of the whole book. I call those things content that are the most closely related to the outcome you are after. The specification of the house you are going to build, the words and phrases of the new language you are learning and so on. You can think of content as opposed to management, that is more concerned about organizing the work than the actual details. 

Resources

What resources do you need to get this project forward? Who are the people that could help you? What skills are relevant for your project? List them out. If you already have related mind maps you can link them to your project. If you have maps related to motorcycle maintenance, and now you want to drive across Africa, link these maps together.

If you are new to managing projects, create a separate map where you can think about project management in general. Collect notes, ideas and best practices about management there. These are not really specific to this project, so a better place would be outside of the actual project maps, in a separate resource map. When you create your next project you can then use that same map again. You can use it as a reference and continue accumulating knowledge and skills that help you become a better manager over time. 

The to-do list

List all the things that you need to do, should do, want to do. Split them smaller. Categorize, prioritize. Get the first one done. Feel good. Repeat.

A to-do list is a typical way to go about organizing the tasks that you have to do to get the project further. The logical place for that is in the management section, right? Well, that is one logical place, but there are others, especially if your project spans multiple maps. If you have separated the management and content of the project to separate maps and spend most of the time in the content map, you might want to have a to-do list there as well, so you don't have to jump between maps that much. Or if you have ten projects that you need to juggle at the same time, you might want to have a centralized to-do list for all of the projects.

After the project

What happens to the maps after the project is done and over? The content sections of this project might become the resource maps for your next projects. The management sections on the other hand is probably not as useful after the project. You might want to do a quick review and reflection, take out any key learning points you come up with and write them down in some of your other maps before archiving the project. 

What next? After you have done your happy dance, take a look at your maps about the future again and start planning your next project, of course. What is the next thing you'd like to work on?
