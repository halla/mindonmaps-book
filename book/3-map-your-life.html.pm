◊h1{Map your life}

You can read all the theory and all the books you want, but it's practice that makes you great. In the following I'll discuss concepts and practices of mind mapping through four practical examples. These are ways I use mind maps all the time: reflecting on the past, planning for the future, learning something new and managing my projects and activities. If you follow through the steps in this chapter you'll be well on your way to exploring and managing your whole life in mind maps.

◊h2{Self biography}

Two acquaintances meet after years. The other one can’t remember their last meeting while the other one cheerfully says: ◊em{“Oh yes, it was the Summer of 2005, we met in that cafe in London, on a Friday afternoon as I was returning home from work.}  Which one reminds you of yourself?

In the Preface I mentioned how I first got excited about mind mapping: I started to write down everything I could remember that had happened to me. This is about that same thing in the form of a self-biography exercise that you can follow, along with discussion on why it makes sense to document your past.

Completing this might not instantly give you a total recall of your whole life. Still, you’ll take a big step in that direction by creating a better index for your memories. That in turn helps you create a better understanding of your life as a continuum from a baby to the present day.


As you probably know, once you put something in your brain it can stay there forever. There are two main reasons for not remembering things. The ◊em{first} one is that those things were not stored well in the memory in the first place. That we can't do anything about afterwards. You may want to learn to memorize things better for the next time. The ◊em{second} reason for bad recall is that you're unable to find the memory in the midst of all the things that have been piling up in your mind during all the years. It's sometimes like trying to find the famous needle in the haystack when you don't even know where the haystack is.

The brain works through ◊em{associations}, by connecting related things together. These connections don't always have to be that logical. In fact, any two things can get associated. Just as Pavlov's dogs started associating the bell to food, your memories are connected to each other in many different ways. You may not always remember things directly, but you can learn to search them through those associations. 

◊h3{Age, year, life phases, locations, people}

When you search the web using a search engine, probably the most important skill is coming up with good keywords. Searching your own memory is not that different. The way I look at it, is that ◊em{anything} you concentrate on, is a ◊em{keyword}, be it an image, a sound or a smell, out in the world or inside your mind. ◊em{Any thought that follows} by association, is a ◊em{search result.}

Write down numbers from 1 to whatever your age is. Under each number write one or two things you remember or know happening when you were that age. It probably helps to add the year next to the age, like 1979 - 1. You might think there is not much difference, but the brain has different associations stored for the age numbers and year numbers. If I think of age 18, one of the things that pop up is me getting my driving license. If, on the other hand I think of the year 1997 I think of high school exams. I probably filled a lot of papers, writing the year number in the exam papers. You might do a quick search for what happened during those years in the world. Reading old news brings back yet another set of different memories. If going through each and every year feels too much, think of major life phases instead, or just split the time in five or ten year slices instead.

One way that memories tend to be strongly associated is through location. Think about the places where you have lived, the specific buildings you've lived in or visited. Imagine being there again. What do you see? What are you doing physically? Are there other people? Listen. What do you hear? With a little practice, if you slow yourself down a bit and take your time, you can learn to move around in the places in your memories.

You might surprise yourself of how much you actually remember if you just stop and think about it. “I don’t remember” often translates to: “I can’t find the memory in five seconds.” It’s like googling the web and giving up if the first result page doesn’t have the answer.

For now, just concentrate on listing as many different things as you can, without getting too much concerned with the details. After you've filled the mind map you'll have a nice overview of your whole life. Not to mention stories to share with your friends the next time you spend an evening together. 

◊h3{Are the memories true}

Without going too deep into the exact meaning of ◊em{truth}, I’d suggest you always take your memories with a grain of salt. Even if you are an autistic memory enigma, your memories won’t be perfect images of the past. That’s just not how the brain works, apparently. It’s not a video camera, or a sound recorder. The memories are typically distorted in one way or another.

A good example of distortion is the distinction between associated and dissociated memories. Sometimes when you think of yourself in the past, an image will come to mind where you see yourself doing something, like you were watching yourself from the outside. This sort of dissociated memories are useful in many ways. They help to see the bigger picture and approach things analytically. They typically take much of the associated feelings away from the thoughts, too. There is just no way they can be exact memories of what you’ve seen or heard or done. Most of us hardly ever actually see ourselves in reality. Well, unless we are looking at a mirror or seeing ourselves on a video.

The unreliability of our memories is a reason to document the past. Do mind mapping, write a personal journal, take photos and document things in other ways. You’ll get access to at least some relatively undistorted information about your history.

It’s useful to be able to make a clear distinction between the past, the present and the future: your personal history, the current reality and your plans and predictions. By creating a separate map, or maps, for your biography we have cleared the path for thinking about the future. You can come back to these maps anytime you feel like contemplating about your past. You can even make it a regular thing. Annual, monthly, weekly or even daily recaps are not really that hard to do. What if you would write down just one thing every single day? How many more good memories would you remember after a few weeks? How about after a month or a year? Too lazy to keep a diary? A few keywords a day will take you a long way.


◊h3{Design your future}

 didn’t plan ahead much back when I was studying at university. I ended up studying computer science, even though it wasn’t my first choice. Many others were quite lost with their life plans, but some had put more thought into them than others. I started to get a bit annoyed by these people because they got so much more done than I did, and made it all seem so effortless. By their freshmen year they already had well paid jobs, and still got their studies done faster, while taking breaks to travel around the world or having a whole exchange year in some cool country abroad. One thing these people had in common was that they knew exactly what they wanted to do, and they knew it a long time in advance.

They planned ahead.

Say you’d like to meet your friend on the weekend. Do you think you have a better chance of organizing the meeting if you start planning about it on Friday afternoon, or if you’d already started on Monday? You’d probably say Monday. What about if you want to become an astronaut? Do you think it makes a difference whether you start planning and working towards it today or tomorrow? Well, not so much. But if you started 10 or 20 years ago, you’d notice a difference. There’s no way to guarantee that you’ll find yourself in outer space, but at least you improve the probability if you start working towards it earlier.

You can plan for a specific project or a calendar year. The plans can be personal or they can be business related. The purpose of planning is to help you figure out the right direction and the steps to get you there. Mind maps can help you in this process. If you have recurring thoughts about making bigger changes in your life, write them down. Don’t keep them in your head. That way you won’t be thinking in circles anymore, but you can keep moving forward with your thoughts.

◊blockquote{

◊p{A clear direction gives you motivation and meaning; actionable next steps help you keep moving and get things done. Everything else is secondary.
}
}

There’s a whole literature out there discussing how to plan effectively. Here, I’ll introduce you the two concepts that I consider to be the most useful in personal life planning. Start with a generic and long term direction you want to be moving towards, and bring it down to small and specific next steps. A clear direction gives you motivation and meaning; actionable next steps help you keep moving and get things done. Everything else is secondary.

◊h3{The Direction}

When you start planning something new, a typical problem that arises is that all the old and existing gets into your way. You could do this and that, but you won’t, because something in your life, or in your mind, stops you. Starting with a ◊em{blank slate} is a useful technique to forget all that long enough to find out what you really want. So put your past and your current situation aside for a moment. You probably had enough of those in the previous self-biography exercise anyway.

define-future_direction

What if there were an easy way to open your mind for new possibilities? What if you had a million dollars? What if you could do anything? What would you do if you were sure you would succeed? Asking ◊em{what-if questions} lets you first find what your ideal situation would look like. And yes, that is what is traditionally also called dreaming. You can imagine your next weekend trip, a career change or whatever you think is important for you right now.

◊blockquote{Don’t confuse what you want with what you think is possible.}

Start a new map and start answering those questions. Again, don’t think too much, write out things off the top of your head to avoid getting stuck. Keep your thoughts flowing. If you hear yourself making up reasons and excuses for why something is not possible, write those in a separate list, but quickly return your focus to the questions. Don’t confuse what you want with what you think is possible. Also, if you find yourself coming up with concrete action steps, write those into yet another list, but return to the original task. Thinking about the practical details is also getting ahead of yourself. Paint with broad strokes. Define yourself a general direction where you’d like your life to move over time.


◊h3{The next steps}

When you have the big picture it’s time to brainstorm and to generate lots of ideas on how to get moving in the desired direction. First, write down everything that comes to mind. Everything. The quantity of ideas is more important than quality. The most common way that I see people get stuck here is their reaction to dumb ideas. The ideas themselves are not smart or dumb. You just think they are one or the other. Writing them all down allows you to bypass the knee-jerk reaction of dismissing them offhand. Just keep on generating them. Maybe the first ten or twenty aren’t that great, but the good and fantastic ones will come, eventually.


After you have a long list of ideas, you can pick the best ones and refine them further. Sometimes you need to clarify facts about your current situation to get a realistic view of the size of gap you need to cross and what is the best first action. Turn the selected ideas to small, concrete action steps. Exactly how small and how specific the steps need to be is personal. For some it’s enough to have a list of keywords to focus on during the week, and they’ll get the things done. Others need more elaboration. “On next Monday at 14:00 I’ll spend 30 minutes online searching for people with similar interests and goals”. If you are not getting things done, keep splitting them into even smaller and more detailed tasks. You’ll soon find the right task size and level of detail for you.

---

And that’s it — for now. We have gone through one round of future planning. Quite simple, right? Now, get to work on those plans. You’ll probably want to come back to these ideas again and refine them further. You can define specific goals, milestones and other metrics to better measure the progress you are making. Rather than a one-time exercise, I see this as a continuous activity in which you gradually get better in defining the direction your life and predicting outcomes for different courses of action.


◊blockquote{Any thought you have about the future is not the future itself.}

Your plans are not the actual future. In fact, any thought you have about the future is not the future itself. It’s a prediction at best. And even if the future in your mind has changed, the world outside doesn’t change, until you act on your plans.


Persistence is a key to achieving any goals in life, and it seems to me that memory plays a big role in that. Your mind maps can remind you about your plans and keep you on track. It’s one thing to not give up in face of adversity, but there is something that comes even before that. I’ve seen people give up on their New Years resolutions, but I’ve also seen as many resolutions simply forgotten.

◊em{Remember what you want.}


◊h2{Learn something new}

Some people believe that learning is hard. Sure, it can be hard at times, but there are ways to make it easier. Know yourself, make a plan and immerse yourself in the subject. Make sure you have a solid idea of what learning means in the first place.

And create a mind map for that.

Do you complicate learning or associate it with bad feelings? Do you think that learning requires a teacher? Do you think it requires a school building or a formal course that takes place during predetermined semesters? Many have unhappy school memories, and the images that come to their mind are classrooms, bullies and grumpy teachers. Forget all that.

◊blockquote{You are learning every day, whether you are aware of it or not}

You are learning every day, whether you are aware of it or not. Even if you are living on autopilot, you are learning. You are enforcing your current behavior, becoming better at whatever it is you do daily, be it speaking a foreign language, cooking or drinking beer.

Whether it is skills or knowledge you are after, the internet has made things easy for us. It is full of free resources to get you started right away. Just go search for them. Learn to play guitar or to stand on your head. You can even enroll on free courses in the world’s best universities and be watching classes by superstar professors in just 10 minutes. The only thing you need is curiosity.

Now, pick a subject. If you did the future planning exercise, you probably have some ideas on what you want or need to learn next. If you don’t have anything special in mind right now, take mind mapping itself as your subject. Create a new map for it before you move on, if you didn’t already.

While mind maps seem to be more suited for learning new knowledge, they can help you learn physical skills too. Even though you have to go and swim in order to learn swimming, there are tons you can do by working with maps. Collect information on the subject, analyze your current situation, set practice goals and plans and so on.

The following simple process starts with analyzing your current situation. By exploring your subject you get to know what there is to learn, and from there you can choose a specific topic to focus on. Repeting these phases again and again takes you dig deeper into the subject. In addition to these intensive phases, additional reviews strengthen your understanding and memory.



◊h3{Orientation}

Show yourself what you already know. Start by listing out everything that comes to mind. If you picked something completely new to you, you might not come up with that many things at first. As with brainstorming, don’t inihibit your thoughts but write down even the ridiculous things that don’t seem relevant at first.

If you want to learn martial arts, you can start by listing all the kung-fu movies you’ve seen. You have to accept that you don’t have a sophisticated understanding on the subject, that your facts are outdated or plain wrong, and that many of the associations you brain finds are more silly than useful.

The initial list of associations becomes the foundation on which you start to build. Be clear with yourself what is your starting point: the strengths or handicaps you might have. If you want to learn algebra, hating math or being allergic to equations count as a handicap.

◊blockquote{What do you want to learn exactly? Why?}

What knowledge or skills are you after? What do you want or need to learn exactly? Write a list of those things. This is going to be the basis for your study plan. Don’t even try to make it perfect the first time. You can come back to revise it as you learn more about your subject.

Why do you want to learn? Write a list of reasons you want to learn this subject for. Write a list of things you’ll be able to do when you learn it. As you get more clear about why you want whatever you want, your motivation grows stronger.

◊h3{Explore}

Make a list of resources you can use for learning. Search the web, look for blogs, browse books on the subject, learn who is who in the field. You get a feel of what is available, and who are the other people learning about the same thing. Even if there is nobody even remotely interested in your subject around where you live, there are probably hundreds or thousands on the internet. Go find them. It’s much easier to learn anything if you have a community of like minded people around you.

Maybe you’ll find a good discussion forum on the subject, video lectures or complete online courses, free e-books, perhaps a book that is a must read. Many fields have specific respected authors or books or movies that people refer to. Those are good places to start. Maybe there are some events that you could attend, to learn about the subject and meet other learners. Exploration gives you an overview of the subject. You also make sure that you have the best possible learning resources at hand when you go further.


◊h3{Study}

Choose one of the learning resources on the list. Pick the one that suits you best and that you can access immediately. Start reading a book, join an online course, watch videos, listen to podcasts, contact people who know about the subject. Write down notes. Organize the notes. Read, listen, watch, apply in practice. Make notes along the way and come back to them to refresh your memory later on.

How much notes should you make and what exactly to write down? You’ll have to learn your own style for taking notes and organizing them, but no matter what your subject is, you are likely to be learning about concepts and their relationships. Beginners in anything often feel like they are learning a whole new language, because there are so many new words they have to pick up before they can have a meaningful discussion with experts of the subject.


◊h3{Repeat}

You don’t become an expert in anything in one hour. It takes time, which means you’ll need to continue this tomorrow, going through the three phases of orientation, exploring and studying again. It’s easy to get stuck in the details or lost exploring the internet forever. That’s why, in the beginning, it’s good to go through all the phases quickly but many times.

On the first round you created yourself a framework and a study plan that make it much easier to come back to the subject another day. On the second round you’ll be able to pick up where you left and to get deeper in each of three phases. Take some time to clean up and reorganize your mind maps to make them better reflect your current understanding and study plans every time you do another round.


◊h3{Review}

Come back to your mind maps again after a day or two, a week, a month, a year, even if you are not actively studying the subject. If you do this, you can refresh what you’ve learned with a very light and fast review. If you just go through the material once and never come back to it, as so often happens in course-based learning, you are likely to forget it. Use repetition to make sure the material sticks in your memory.

—

What about the autopilot? Everything that is not part of your daily routine is going to require extra effort from you and is at the risk of being forgotten. What if consciously exploring and learning new was part of your routine? What could you learn in a year? In five years? I’d be curious.


◊h2{Let's get to work - start a project}

So what is a project anyway? Sounds like work, huh? I call it a project when you want to get something done, something big enough that you need to do some planning and keep track of things. Or, in mind maps, it's big enough that you have at least one dedicated map for it, and probably it spans multiple maps. It's a way to get organized. The time scale can be a week or a year, whatever makes sense to your project. 

If you did the future design exercise, you should have something in your mind maps to start working on. Or maybe your life is perfect already, in which case you could start a book or a movie project to let others know how you made it happen.

The structure I find myself using is loosely based on systems methodology. A technical description would be that a project is a future-oriented system that produces an output, or a change in the environment. It is a way to organize yourself, your actions, and your resources to reach a specific goal. 

◊h3{Management}

It's useful to separate the management of the project from the actual content. When in management mode, you put on the boss hat and think about the project as a whole. What are the things needed to be done and when, who are the people related to this project and what are the goals. You can create a management branch in your project map, or a separate management map, depending on the size of the project. 

◊h3{Content}

If you run your own one man project you need to put your hands in the dirt as well. In the case of a book writing project the main content is the content of the book. The actual text is probably edited somewhere else, but part of the process can be done in mind maps, such as all the ideas and notes about how to improve the text, as well as the outline of the whole book. I call those things content that are the most closely related to the outcome you are after. The specification of the house you are going to build, the words and phrases of the new language you are learning and so on. You can think of content as opposed to management, that is more concerned about organizing the work than the actual details. 

◊h3{Resources}

What resources do you need to get this project forward? Who are the people that could help you? What skills are relevant for your project? List them out. If you already have related mind maps you can link them to your project. If you have maps related to motorcycle maintenance, and now you want to drive across Africa, link these maps together.

If you are new to managing projects, create a separate map where you can think about project management in general. Collect notes, ideas and best practices about management there. These are not really specific to this project, so a better place would be outside of the actual project maps, in a separate resource map. When you create your next project you can then use that same map again. You can use it as a reference and continue accumulating knowledge and skills that help you become a better manager over time. 

◊h3{The to-do list}

List all the things that you need to do, should do, want to do. Split them smaller. Categorize, prioritize. Get the first one done. Feel good. Repeat.

A to-do list is a typical way to go about organizing the tasks that you have to do to get the project further. The logical place for that is in the management section, right? Well, that is one logical place, but there are others, especially if your project spans multiple maps. If you have separated the management and content of the project to separate maps and spend most of the time in the content map, you might want to have a to-do list there as well, so you don't have to jump between maps that much. Or if you have ten projects that you need to juggle at the same time, you might want to have a centralized to-do list for all of the projects.

◊h3{After the project}

What happens to the maps after the project is done and over? The content sections of this project might become the resource maps for your next projects. The management sections on the other hand is probably not as useful after the project. You might want to do a quick review and reflection, take out any key learning points you come up with and write them down in some of your other maps before archiving the project. 

What next? After you have done your happy dance, take a look at your maps about the future again and start planning your next project, of course. What is the next thing you'd like to work on?
