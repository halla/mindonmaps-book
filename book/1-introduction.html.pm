â—Šh1{Introduction}

Before we get into action I'd like to get you into the right mindset for this book and set some expectations straight. 

If the the word 'mind map' brings to your mind an image of a big sheet of paper, with lots of drawings and colors and artistic expression, maybe with many people involved, please put that image aside now. 

The focus of this book is on personal, computer assisted thinking with mind maps. My first priorities are speed, flexibility and scalability. I'm not talking about a few dozen ideas you fix on a piece of paper that you then frame and put on the wall. You can do that too and definitely should at least try it if you haven't yet. It can be a very powerful exercise that can help you integrate your thoughts and discover and appreciate your capability of creative thinking, especially if you are new to mind maps. I'm talking, however, about hundreds and thousands of notes and ideas in dozens or hundreds of maps that you keep on changing and moving around on a daily basis. If that sounds like a lot that's exactly the point. There's no way you you can handle that using just a pen and paper, let alone just in your mind. Therefore the computer.

This book does not discuss mind maps as a presentation tool or a tool for collaboration. I'm not saying you shouldn't use them for those purposes. I just haven't had much experience with those, and therefore I am not an expert to say much about it. This book concentrates exclusively on mind mapping as reflective activity of a single person.

This book is an introduction to thinking with mind maps. I'll first discuss why it is a good idea to use a computer for that. Then I'll present some exercises that you can do to get some hands on experience with personal reflection, studying and planning. In the chapter Working with your mind maps I'll discuss mind mapping in general, looking at common activities, recurring structures and patterns, and some principles and personal practices. I'll end with considering some elementary skills that you can work on to become a better mind mapper.

Mind mapping, the way I see it, is often exploratory activity. There is no set way of doing things just as there is no single right way of thinking in general. I'll give you many different kinds of ideas that you can go on and try out for yourself. Just keep an open mind, try out different things, and keep what works.
