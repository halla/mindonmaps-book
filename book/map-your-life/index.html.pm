You can read all the theory and all the books you want, but it's practice that makes you great. In the following I'll discuss concepts and practices of mind mapping through four practical examples. These are ways I use mind maps all the time: reflecting on the past, planning for the future, learning something new and managing my projects and activities. If you follow through the steps in this chapter you'll be well on your way to exploring and managing your whole life in mind maps.
