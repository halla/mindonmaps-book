◊h1{Memory card for the brain}

Chances are that you do some sort of thinking every day, and not many people would oppose being able to “think better”, whatever that means.

Think about mental arithmetic. You can calculate 2 + 2 in your mind, but 345983274592834 + 2345234545 is difficult for most of us. That doesn't mean you can't do it at all. You just can't do it in your mind that easily. Take a paper an a pencil and you can solve the sum in a a minute if you want. 

You've probably heard of the limits of our working memory. We can only hold 5-7 items at a time there. Whether that number is exact isn't that important. The point is, that the brain's capacity to hold thoughts in our minds has a ◊em{limit}, and that limit ◊em{is not impressive}. Mind maps can help you break that limit by acting as an extension for your thoughts. 

Just as pen and paper extended your ability to calculate, mind maps can extend your ability to think in general. The mind mapping application on your computer is the pencil and eraser you use to create and modify the contents of the maps. The maps are, like the paper, an external memory storage for your brain.
