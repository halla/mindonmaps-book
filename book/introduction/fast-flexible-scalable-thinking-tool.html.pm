◊h1{Fast, flexible and scalable thinking tool}

If the the words 'mind map' bring to your mind an image of a big sheet of paper, with lots of drawings and colors and artistic expression, maybe with many people involved, please put that image aside now. 

The focus of this book is on personal, computer assisted thinking with mind maps. My first priorities are speed, flexibility and scalability. My mind maps are dynamic and they are connected. I have hundreds or thousands of notes and ideas in dozens or hundreds of maps that I keep on changing and moving around on a daily basis. If that sounds like a lot that’s exactly the point. There’s no way I can handle that using just a pen and paper, let alone just in my mind. Therefore the computer.

I won’t discuss much about mind maps as a presentation tool or a tool for collaboration. I’m not saying you shouldn’t use them for those purposes. I just haven’t had much experience with those, and therefore I am not an expert to say much about it. Mind mapping is personal, reflective activity for me.
