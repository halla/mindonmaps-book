â—Šh1{Introduction}

This book is an introduction to thinking with mind maps. I'll first discuss why it is a good idea to use a computer for that. Then I'll present some exercises that you can do to get some hands on experience with personal reflection, studying and planning. In the chapter Working with your mind maps I'll discuss mind mapping in general, looking at common activities, recurring structures and patterns, and some principles and personal practices. I'll end with considering some elementary skills that you can work on to become a better mind mapper.

Mind mapping, the way I see it, is often exploratory activity. There is no set way of doing things just as there is no single right way of thinking in general. I'll give you many different kinds of ideas that you can go on and try out for yourself. Just keep an open mind, try out different things, and keep what works.
