◊h1{Introduction: Fast, flexible and scalable thinking tool}


If the the words 'mind map' bring to your mind an image of a big sheet of paper, with lots of drawings and colors and artistic expression, maybe with many people involved, please put that image aside now. 

The focus of this book is on personal, computer assisted thinking with mind maps. My first priorities are speed, flexibility and scalability. My mind maps are dynamic and they are connected. I have hundreds or thousands of notes and ideas in dozens or hundreds of maps that I keep on changing and moving around on a daily basis. If that sounds like a lot that’s exactly the point. There’s no way I can handle that using just a pen and paper, let alone just in my mind. Therefore the computer.

I won’t discuss much about mind maps as a presentation tool or a tool for collaboration. I’m not saying you shouldn’t use them for those purposes. I just haven’t had much experience with those, and therefore I am not an expert to say much about it. Mind mapping is personal, reflective activity for me.

This book is an introduction to thinking with mind maps. I'll first discuss why it is a good idea to use a computer for that. Then I'll present some exercises that you can do to get some hands on experience with personal reflection, studying and planning. In the chapter Working with your mind maps I'll discuss mind mapping in general, looking at common activities, recurring structures and patterns, and some principles and personal practices. I'll end with considering some elementary skills that you can work on to become a better mind mapper.

Mind mapping, the way I see it, is often exploratory activity. There is no set way of doing things just as there is no single right way of thinking in general. I'll give you many different kinds of ideas that you can go on and try out for yourself. Just keep an open mind, try out different things, and keep what works.
