â—Šh1{Communication}

Now what good are communication skills for thinking? I like to think of thinking as communicating with myself. Have you ever wondered why is it that you sometimes need a language to explain something to yourself? Isn't that a bit strange? If you are able to explain it to yourself, it means you already knew it. If you already had the knowledge, why did you have to tell about it to yourself? 

At the risk of sounding schizophrenic, I think it is useful to think about yourself as two persons. Especially when you use an external device such as mind maps. It makes sense also in the way that you might read the mind map a week, a month or a year later, so you are leaving messages to your future self. You'd better be clear in your communication with yourself. Otherwise, you're going to have some hard times interpreting your own maps when coming back to them after a some time.
