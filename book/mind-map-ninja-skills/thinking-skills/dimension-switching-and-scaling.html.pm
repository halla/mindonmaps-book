â—Šh1{Dimension switching and scaling}

If we want to consider all the different angles to an issue, we need to identify its properties and consider how changing them changes the situation. An object that you can hold in your hand has visible properties such as color or size. You can feel the texture of the object, maybe it is smooth or rugged, warm or cold. Smell the object, you can even taste the object. Go on, this is just a thought experiment. It might make you smile a little but it's not that dangerous. Now drop the object. Does it make a sound when it hits the surface? Is the sound quiet or LOUD? A light soft object falling on a soft ground makes a different sound than a fragile glass object falling on a stone floor. Add a time dimension. Think about someone who did this experiment a hundred years ago, who did it repeatedly for ten days and never cleaned up the broken glass from the floor. You can imagine all sorts of things with a little practice. Whatever those things are, you can generate even more ideas by breaking the ones you have apart into components and changing their properties.
