◊leading-words{You are not} your ideas, you are not your emotions. 

At first, if you are not accustomed to it, the abundance of ideas you generate while mind mapping might feel like a trip to a candy land. But just as too much sweets is not good for your health, too many ideas might end up paralyzing you. It's just like the jedi-thing. You are encouraged to love your mind maps. Just don't get too attached to them.
