â—Šh1{Acceptance}

Just to repeat: the mind map is just a tool. The point is not a perfect list, or categorization or pretty picture. The point is to create an effect outside the mind map, in the real world. If you want to make something change in your life or to get something done, good enough is good enough. Accept it and move on.
