◊h1{Thinking skills}

How exactly do you think? It helps to become aware of the ways of your thoughts in order to better direct and modify them at will. 

◊h3{Meta-hopping}

The term meta is used at least in two a bit different ways that's good to be aware of. 

The first one means a higher level of abstraction. We can talk about a specific house or houses in general, on a meta level. You want to be able to take generic concepts and take them down to concrete level. You also want to be able to take concrete observations and make abstractions, to see how they relate together at a more generic level.

Think about a house, then about a little green wooden cabin, then about a generic building. Learn to move between these different levels of generalization consciously and to notice on what level you are thinking. You can more easily spot yourself making hasty conclusions, too. You went to Zimbalandia for a vacation and thought that all the buildings were so beautiful there. Or wait a minute. Maybe it was just that one little green wooden cabin in that one village that made an impression on you.

The other meaning of meta is as in the word 'about'. Meta information is information about information. The publication year of this book is information about this book, but not really content to this book. The content is still information in itself. Now, think about yourself thinking about thinking. Sounds complicated? By thinking about that sentence, you are taking it even one step further. You are thinking about thinking about yourself thinking about thinking. Keep it all in your head and it makes you feel dizzy. Write it down and it starts to make sense. This, sometimes called metacognition, is a very straightforward thing to do using mind maps. You can add as many levels of meta as you want and still be able to keep track of the thought.

◊h3{Dimension switching and scaling}

If we want to consider all the different angles to an issue, we need to identify its properties and consider how changing them changes the situation. An object that you can hold in your hand has visible properties such as color or size. You can feel the texture of the object, maybe it is smooth or rugged, warm or cold. Smell the object, you can even taste the object. Go on, this is just a thought experiment. It might make you smile a little but it's not that dangerous. Now drop the object. Does it make a sound when it hits the surface? Is the sound quiet or LOUD? A light soft object falling on a soft ground makes a different sound than a fragile glass object falling on a stone floor. Add a time dimension. Think about someone who did this experiment a hundred years ago, who did it repeatedly for ten days and never cleaned up the broken glass from the floor. You can imagine all sorts of things with a little practice. Whatever those things are, you can generate even more ideas by breaking the ones you have apart into components and changing their properties. 

◊h3{Systems thinking}

Everything is related to everything else. You cannot really understand things in isolation but need to take the environment, the context, into account. You can't understand what a car is just by taking it into pieces. To get the whole picture, you also need to know who is using it, for what and how exactly. Cars are not just wheels and engines. They are streets, parking lots, taxi drivers, speeding tickets and road trips too.

You want to cook a dinner. The ingredients that go into the food are called inputs. These ingredients have different functions. Some provide flavor, some bring color, some are there just to fill your stomach. The steps you make to make the food is called process. The purpose of the stove or oven you use is to heat the food and the result you serve on the table is the output. If you look and taste the food, you can get some feedback about the quality, and you can use that knowledge to tune the parameters, the ingredients or the cooking time, to get better results next time. You get the context from the facts, that it is Winter in Alaska and it's your new date whom you are making dinner for the very first time. The expression on your date's face gives you feedback again. Maybe your main course was a delicious steak. You just didn't take into account the fact that your date is vegetarian. Oops.

Systems thinking is a way to solve all kinds of problems by seeing them as a part of a bigger whole. No matter how good your steak is, no matter how optimized your cooking process is, you can still fail if you don't take the context into account. Systems give us a language and terms to talk and think about any activity, regardless of the scale or the subject. You can use that terminology to discuss both cooking and global economics. 

◊h3{Creativity}

This is a loaded concept and everybody you ask will give you a different definition. The definition I find the most useful, is the one which divides creativity in to flexibility and fluency. Flexibility is the more familiar one, the one where you are able to come up with wildly different ideas. That is often traditionally considered creative thinking. Fluency means that you are able to produce any ideas at a constant rate, say one per second or two. Combine these two and voilá, you are creative professional. 

You can practice creativity just by combining the above mentioned meta-hopping, dimension switching and systems thinking. There is no magic in it. It's just a simple recipe, lots of repetition. A house, big house, a house in the 1500s, a red house, a concert house, a gallery, a little girl going to buy fresh bread in the 1500s from a big red bakery that has an art gallery and live music in the lobby etc. You get the drill.

The biggest barrier to creativity that I see people having is their reaction to dumb ideas. Some say there are no dumb ideas. I say there are lots of them, all over the place. But it's ok! Just keep on generating them ideas. Maybe the first ten or twenty or fifty are useless, but the good and fantastic ones will come, eventually. Trust me.

◊h3{Communication}

Now what good are communication skills for thinking? I like to think of thinking as communicating with myself. Have you ever wondered why is it that you sometimes need a language to explain something to yourself? Isn't that a bit strange? If you are able to explain it to yourself, it means you already knew it. If you already had the knowledge, why did you have to tell about it to yourself? 

At the risk of sounding schizophrenic, I think it is useful to think about yourself as two persons. Especially when you use an external device such as mind maps. It makes sense also in the way that you might read the mind map a week, a month or a year later, so you are leaving messages to your future self. You'd better be clear in your communication with yourself. Otherwise, you're going to have some hard times interpreting your own maps when coming back to them after a some time.
