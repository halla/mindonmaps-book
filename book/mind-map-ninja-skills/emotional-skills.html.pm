◊h1{Emotional skills}

What does mind mapping have to do with emotions? Lots! You don't believe me? Take a few minutes to create a new map on a subject you really care about. After you have a few dozen items there, stop. Delete everything. What? No! My precious ideas... You get the idea. 

◊h3{Recognize your feelings}

<3 <3 <3 Let's get emotional. :) Some people literally jump when they hear or see the word feeling. Feeling, feeling, FEELING. Love, hate, anger, fear, happiness, sadness, contempt, hope. Did reading that make you uncomfortable? Even a bit embarrassed? Well, those are feelings too, right there. 

In case you score high on scientific logical left-brain boxes-and-arrows tests you might have to work on this a bit. I know I had to. If you are an extreme case, start by accepting the fact that feelings are part of the human experience and that goes for you too. That doesn't mean you have to like your feelings, especially the bad ones (that's why they are called that way). 

Recognize the feelings you encounter when you think. Basically every idea that you write down in the map has a feeling attached to it, however small. Some ideas make you excited, others not so much. Some ideas never make it to the map, because you are not comfortable saying them out aloud, writing them down or even thinking about them. 

If you want to be all objective about your feelings, be aware of your body, and you'll notice that you'll actually get visible physical reactions from words and ideas. Your heart rate, breathing pattern and muscle tension change. You can be rational about your emotions too.

◊h3{Let go of your ideas}

At first, if you are not accustomed to it, the abundance of ideas you generate while mind mapping might feel like a trip to a candy land. But just as too much sweets is not good for your health, too many ideas might end up paralyzing you. It's just like the jedi-thing. You are encouraged to love your mind maps. Just don't get too attached to them.

◊h3{Break out of your labels and categories}

We have a tendency to label the things we experience, group them and put them into boxes. In essence, that is half of what mind mapping is about, too. The other half is analyzing the boxes you or someone else has defined. However, there are no boxes and labels in reality. 

Labels often have emotional components attached to them, stereotypes and prejudices being a prime example that. These emotions may prevent you from thinking clearly about those subjects. The stronger and clearer a label is for you, the more certain you are that you know what it means. The more certain you are, the less likely you are to learn anything new about it. One way to break out of a box is to accept that you don't really know. You just think you know. Become curious about how much there is that you don't know about things around you. 

◊hh3{Accept the imperfection}

Just to repeat: the mind map is just a tool. The point is not a perfect list, or categorization or pretty picture. The point is to create an effect outside the mind map, in the real world. If you want to make something change in your life or to get something done, good enough is good enough. Accept it and move on.
