◊h1{Physical skills}

You want to become faster in using your tools. At the time of writing this book the main way for us to communicate with computers is our hands. We either hammer the keyboard or click around with the mouse. The mouse is there to get you started, but in the long run it will slow you down. The keyboard is there for the serious work. 

◊h3{Keyboard shortcuts}

What's common to many people that are exceptionally efficient working with specific computer applications? They do most of the work using the keyboard and only rarely need to touch the mouse. 

Learn to use the keyboard for all the most frequent tasks like insert, edit, delete, move, copy, paste, create link etc. If your mind mapping software doesn't let you do the most frequent actions by keyboard, you might want to look for alternatives. 

◊h3{Touch typing}

Even if you are not the sharpest pencil in the box, the speed of your thinking is much faster than the speed of your typing. The faster you write, the less likely you are to get bored waiting for your fingers to write all those things you want to appear on the screen. You don't want to look at your fingers all the time either. You want to keep your eyes on the mind map, looking for connections between ideas, staying focused on the thing you are thinking about. Even if you already know the basics of touch typing, when was the last time you took a typing test? If you score less than 400 characters per minute (cpm) there's still room for improvement. The fastest typists can achieve speeds of over 1000 cpm.
