◊h1{Working with mind maps}

In this chapter we'll go through some common activities that you'll find yourself doing while mind mapping. Each of these activites are going to present you with different kinds of challenges. We discuss a few principles that will guide you with recurring decisions you have to make.

◊h2{Information filing}

When taking notes or brainstorming you typically write down words or phrases, one after another. At first, you have a simple list of items, but as the number of ideas grows this kind of list becomes impractical. If you start thinking about the items, you can find similarities and differences between them. Based on your analysis, you can group and organize the items under common labels, your categories. This is not unlike the work of a librarian who has a thousand books and tries to put a label on each noting which section of the library the book belongs to. The same filing process happens at a larger scale too. Say you have a hundred maps, and you have to decide in which one of these a specific piece of information should be stored. 

We'll come back the problem of an optimal storage location more a bit later with the principle of locality. Basically it comes down to two things: the speed of adding items into your maps and the speed of finding them again later. It often makes sense to do the collection and organization of information separately. If you are in a situation where you need to take notes quickly, you don't want to spend too much time finding the right place for each note. It is more important to just write everything down, and you can then organize then better later. On the other hand, if you do have some extra time, you might want to spend some of it just reorganizing your existing notes and maps, so that you'll find what you need from them faster in the future.

◊h2{Orientation}

No, I don't mean running in the forest with a map and a compass, even though it's not completely unrelated either. To find the place marked with X it helps to know where you are going, where you are now, and where you are coming from. We have seen this pattern already in starting to learn a new subject and in planning your life. Generally, it comes up whenever you do any goal oriented activity. Where am I right now? How did I end up here? Where was I the last time I checked? Where do I want to go? How am I going to get there? This is the first thing we all do in the morning, even if we are not always that conscious about it. We do this whenever we continue anything that was left unfinished.

How much should you spend time thinking of the past, present and the future then? Sometimes you don't need to know much at all about your past or even about the present. You are swimming on a beach. You know you want to swim back to the shore you see in front you. You don't need to know exactly how far is it or what was your exact swimming path so far. You just need to keep your focus on the shore and swim until you get there.

The other extreme is a labyrinth. You know you want to get to the other side of it, but knowing that doesn't help you much. What helps is to know exactly what path you've taken so far, which direction you are heading at the moment and what your options are. This is like knowing exactly what you want but having know idea where to find it. You might bump into it by chance, of course. If you are not that lucky, however, you'll have to figure it out by learning where it's not.

So, where was I? Oh yes, I was explaining about the concept of orientation and trying to make the point that it is a recurring activity pattern that is useful to be aware of. 

◊h2{Refactoring}

Your first map starts to grow. The more you think and write down things, the bigger the map gets. You rarely delete things from your map. If some items seem irrelevant at the moment, you create a new branch in your map to store those. 

If a single branch of the map grows much faster than the others you start to think how to best return balance to your map. You need to refactor, or restructure, your mind maps. One way is to create a new branch on top level, or to come up with another way of categorizing the items. You can then move items from the overgrown branch back closer to the center. If you first try to categorize your items to branches called 'big' and 'small', you can add a category 'medium', if the two categories become too big. If you notice that most of the items are in one category, you can switch to another set of categories. Maybe dividing by color instead of size would make more sense, and you could switch to categories 'black' and 'white' instead.

Another option is to cut the branch off and continue developing it in a new map that you link to the original. This type of spin-offs are common in the beginning of any new venture. You decide to start a physical training program to get yourself back in shape. The next day you find yourself studying about healthy nutrition and human anatomy. However important and relevant these are for your goal, they are still most likely sidetracks. If you start studying those things and include them in your training map, you might think you are getting somewhere, because the map is evolving. Even though you just skipped your physical exercises today, again. To keep your original focus, create new maps for your new study fields and link them to your training map as resources.

◊h2{Moving between maps}

As the number of your mind maps grow, you'll find that the need to move and switch between different maps grows as well. There are several ways to move between the maps, and this is also more or less specific to the application you use. 

You can typically open a mind map file directly by browsing the file system, but it's not always the easiest way. If you are in the middle of a thought, a way to move between maps without breaking your flow is through associative links you have put in place. These are links inside a map pointing to another map. Your map called Europe can contain links to maps about specific countries and the other way around. You can then follow these links to move between these maps. You can also create specific index maps to quickly navigate between a large number of maps.

It's a good idea to develop yourself a quick and smooth way to navigate your maps. Too big indexes or having to browse through too many files floods your working memory with irrelevant ideas and you'll get easily distracted. The next thing you notice you are in YouTube watching cat videos, wondering what you were doing before ending up there. So, make it easy for yourself.

◊h2{Maintenance}

Take regularly some time off from your thinking and learning and spend some time on gardening, weeding, cleaning, taking the garbage out and sharpening the saw. Your maps are going to collect all kinds of clutter, that makes using them harder and distract you from the main purpose, or restrict generation of new ideas. 

Maintenance is also the time you'll clean up all the temporary storages you've been accumulating since the last cleaning day. Move the items to their right places, or move them to the recycling bin. Or just delete them. Remaining undecided about them leaves you with unfinished business that's going to haunt you forever. Or until you clean them up. So clean them up.

◊h2{Evolution}

As you use mind maps more, you start to figure out what works and what doesn't. At first you try some structures and categories that feel good to you. Maybe they even work for a while. Then something happens. Maybe they grow too big, or your focus changes, maybe your life situation changes, and you start to look at things differently. Maybe the balance between your work and personal life changes. The focus and organization of your maps starts to shift. You come up with a new way to organize things. You don't go and change all the old mind maps but gradually start to do things in a new way. It doesn't have to be a result of any especially intelligent design, some of the changes just happen, some even by chance. You hit a wrong keyboard shortcut and accidentally discover a quick way to represent the stage of your project tasks by using colors. After a year you look back at your old maps and you notice that a big change has taken place.

◊h2{Revolution}

Sometimes the maintenance is not enough, things go forward too slowly for your liking. You get frustrated with the current system, it's not up to date, hasn't been able to keep up with the changing times. It's time for a revolution. Throw off the old maps and start with a blank slate.

The new ideology will give you new strength and lots of ideas at first. You might end up with a radically better organization of your maps, but it's never guaranteed. Sooner or later the everyday arrives. Revolutions are not always that successful, you'll notice that newer doesn't always mean better. You'll go back to old habits, the old things need to be done too, and the ideology itself is not enough for that. You'll start to appreciate some things that you had in place in the past. Make sure you don't throw all the babies with the bathwater when you do radical changes. 

I have always one main mind map that is my starting point. That is the map I open first when I turn on my computer. It reflects those things that are the most important for me at the moment. Some time in the past I found myself stuck with that map so often that I decided to create a new main mind map from scratch regularly. Usually I change it every half a year, or even more often, if I have bigger life events that are logical moments to clean the table. 

◊h2{Review and reflect}

Sometimes you just want to browse through your old maps and review them. You can do systematic reviews of your notes, or you can browse through them at random every now and then. A review can significantly increase your retention rate of new things. You can browse around your maps and notice how the way of your thinking and using mind maps has changed over time. Your thinking style probably differs between different subjects too. You might have a certain approach to your personal life and another to your work life. Noticing these changes and differences can teach you a lot about yourself. 

The more maps you have on different subjects, the richer source of new ideas you are going to have. That's because one way to come up with new ideas is to combine two old ideas together. By wandering around your maps aimlessly, randomly, you can make new and unexpected associations and connections between ideas. Lots of “Aha!” moments waiting for you here.

◊h2{Principles}

Where should I put this one item? Should it go here or there? Should I start a new map? Here are the main principles I follow when making these kinds of decisions. They may not give you a straight answer, but at least they provide some guidance on how to think about these questions.

◊h3{Locality, frequency, cohesion}

Think about your home, your desk, your kitchen. What are the things that you keep most easily accessible? It's probably the things you need the most often. Those things that you need once a month you can keep inside a cupboard and those you need only once a year you can keep buried somewhere in the basement. In the same way you can organize your maps so that the things you need most often are most easily accessible and those you don't need are moved out of the way.

Then you group items with a similar function together. If you have the salt here you probably don't put the pepper on the other side of the room. The kitchen might have some non-food functions too. You might have pen and paper in the there so you can write down things for a shopping list whenever you see something is missing, or maybe you want to leave notes to other family members, and the kitchen table or the door of the fridge happens to act as the bulletin board in the house. 

Say you have a storage room up in the attic, or outdoors, or down in basement or other side of the town and you want to take something there. You store them somewhere temporarily first. When you get enough stuff waiting or you cannot move in your lobby anymore you finally move them all the way to the final destination. The same way you can create temporary storages for your notes and ideas. 

Sometimes you use a selection of items so often that you create a separate place for them. You have the salt and pepper on the table, even though you have a whole collection of other spices in the house. Similarly, if I was planning a trip to France I would probably keep some of the most relevant information about the country in my Trip-to-France map but keep the bulk of the country information somewhere else and just link to it.

◊h3{Information hiding}

There probably are some items in your mind maps that seem to get in your way. By being clear about the main purpose of each map you can limit their contents only to the most relevant things.

When I'm writing the content for this book I want to be fully immersed in it. There are many things related to writing the book, such as management of the whole book writing project or my another project on becoming a better writer in general. Still, I don't want them in my book content map. I add links to them, so that I find them if I need them. In addition, when I do access them, the clicking of the link helps me to make a conscious context switch. My whole mindset changes when I move from the writer mode to the management mode. 

Many mind map tools have a feature called folding. Folding allows you to quickly hide and show parts of a mind map, which will help you stay concentrated on a part of a map at a time. Folding has its limits though. My biggest maps have had thousands of items. I could fold most of those out of view but in practice these maps quickly became very hard to use. There is rarely a need to have everything in one map. See if you can move part of the items to a new map and link those two maps together.

◊h3{Modularity}

Following the principle of information hiding leads to a modular structure. You can reuse some maps in many different contexts. Continuing the book writing example, I don't want to mix the methodology of writing with the actual book content. First of all it distracts my focus from the content, but also because by creating a separate map for it I can reuse it. I can link the generic writing map to any other writing related map and find and access it easily for example when writing blog articles.

◊h3{Similarity}

When I first got excited about mind mapping, I really made maps about everything that came to mind. Each map ended up a little bit different, and I had trouble figuring out a good structure that would fit them all. 

It was quite confusing to jump from one map to another and always having to start with the question of what in the world I've been thinking here. The more maps I created the harder it became to manage all that diversity. I tried many different ways to organize it all, and I gradually gravitated towards simpler and simpler structures. 

I tried to find a structure that I could repeat all over again in any context, that would allow me to scale my map repository to ever bigger number of maps. No matter how much content I would add in my maps, I wanted the structure to retain its most basic shape, and enable me to have some kind of hold of it all. One such structure that served as an ideal for me was the fractal, a simple pattern that you can repeat forever and scales infinitely. In nature these kinds of patterns are all over the place. In computer science a related concept is recursion. If you are not familiar with those terms, it doesn't really matter. 

The main point is this: almost all of my current maps look more or less similar to each other. For example, most of them have a management or meta branch that contains information about the map in question and its purpose, maybe with a to-do list and a journal. They also have a context branch that tells me what else outside of the map is relevant to the topic, along with links to related maps. The maps share a common basic structure, even if their content and purpose would be totally different. It makes dealing with a growing number of maps much, much simpler. 

◊h3{Content or structure first?}

Sometimes you start with generating a lot of ideas and only later organize them to categories, when you start noticing patterns. On the other hand, sometimes you already have the categories, a clearly defined set of questions to answer or boxes to be fill. 

To keep an open mind, let the content drive the structure. First create a collection of ideas, then organize it. If you want to do any out-of-the-box thinking the easiest way to do it is to not put yourself in a box in the first place. By creating a table of contents, an outline or a categorization, you are in effect defining the box. Predefining the structure will get in your way by directing and limiting your thinking.

Directing and limiting can also be a good thing, especially when you are repeating something. You don't need creativity to do routine tasks. The more you repeat something, the less you'll probably want to think about it! Nevertheless, you'll want to make sure that every aspect gets covered. Checklists and standard forms are useful for that.
